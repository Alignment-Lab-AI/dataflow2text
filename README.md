## Introduction (WIP)

There are two key components in our framework: **dataflow transduction** and **constrained decoding**,
implemented by the [dataflow2text](./dataflow2text) package and the [clamp](./clamp) package, respectively.

- These two packages currently use two different Python versions.
  The `dataflow2text` package relies on [the structural pattern matching feature introduced in Python 3.10](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.10.html),
  whereas the `clamp` package heavily relies on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [ðŸ¤— Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index).
- The clamp package is a simplified version of the code for [Semantic Parsing with Constrained LM](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic_parsing_with_constrained_lm/).

To reproduce the SMCalFlow2Text results reported in the paper, please refer to the [worksheets](./worksheets/) folder.
You will need to create two python virtual environments.

```bash
conda env create --file=dataflow2text/environment.yml --name=dataflow2text_py310

conda env create --file=clamp/environment.yml --name=clamp_py37
```

More details coming soon!
